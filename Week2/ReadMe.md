# ðŸŒ¸ IRIS Flower Classification using Decision Tree

This project demonstrates a simple **Machine Learning pipeline** for classifying Iris flower species using the **Decision Tree Classifier** from `scikit-learn`.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The **Iris dataset** is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species â€” *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*.  
The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal dimensions.

This script:
1. Loads the Iris dataset.
2. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
3. Trains a Decision Tree model.
4. Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance.
5. Saves the trained model for later use.
